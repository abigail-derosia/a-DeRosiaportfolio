  <h1> ART 222 </h1>
  <h2>Project 1 - Artist Statement</h2>
<p> For this project I wanted it to appeal to all ages but be more geared towards kids. The Southworth planetarium has a lot of events for kids so I wanted to include elements that younger children could recognize easily. My design includes a design of the moon and saturn as well as some stars. I did not want my design to be too busy because I feel like that can be very overwhelming and confusing for viewers. The last thing I wanted my design to do was be multi purpose. I wanted the design to be easily manipulated and usable for different purposes like brochures, stickers etc. </p>
