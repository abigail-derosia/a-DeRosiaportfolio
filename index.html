  <h1> ART 222 </h1>
  <h2>Project 1 - Artist Statement</h2>
<p> For this project I wanted it to appeal to all ages but be more geared towards kids. The Southworth planetarium has a lot of events for kids so I wanted to include elements that younger children could recognize easily. My design includes a design of the moon and saturn as well as some stars. I did not want my design to be too busy because I feel like that can be very overwhelming and confusing for viewers. The last thing I wanted my design to do was be multi purpose. I wanted the design to be easily manipulated and usable for different purposes like brochures, stickers etc. </p>

<h2>Project 2 - Photo Manipulation</h2>
<p>I will be creating a dystopian scene with various images of current social issues and events that have been happening in the US specifically to point out how close we are to falling into a dystopian society with the current administration under Donald Trump. I focused on he "no kings protests that have been happening all around the country, and took some images I found online of officers who were at these protests. The reality of this piece is that this could have been one photo, not multiple. I believe that speaks volumes as to what is happening in our country and our world.</p>
<p>Below is my final photo manipulation design</p>

  <h2>Project 3 - Video Editing </h2>
<p>I based my project on the declining state of our environment. I believe some people may think climate change has only recently become an issue for the world, but using these videos, made from both corporations and individual home videos showing people enjoying nature from the 1940’s and on, shows the audience that this has been an issue. The clips individually have a lot of meaning, but by combining the visual and audio aspects of them, it will enhance the emotional appeal about who and what will be further affected by climate change if there is not anything done about this crisis. I want my audience to walk away and think about what impact humans have had on our environment. I want the audience to feel empowered to do something about the crisis we have faced for decades, and realize that if we as a society take the right steps we can create visible change. 
As I have mentioned, a big inspiration for this project is the climate crisis and how it is being handled by the entire world but more specifically how it’s being mishandled by our government. This administration has denied that climate change is real numerous times despite the overwhelming proof that it is real and is a serious issue. Now more than ever it is important to realize that we have the power to influence change in our world. </p>
